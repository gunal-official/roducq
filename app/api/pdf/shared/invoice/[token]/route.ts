/**
 * GET /api/pdf/shared/invoice/<token> — the CLIENT-side PDF download
 * (PDF export, 2026-09-27): the same invoice document the recipient sees at
 * /invoice/<token>, as a file they can file, forward or pay against.
 *
 * NO AUTH, by design — the token IS the credential, exactly as on the page:
 *   - data comes ONLY from the get_shared_invoice SECURITY DEFINER RPC
 *     (lib/data/invoices.getSharedInvoiceByToken), which returns zero rows,
 *     indistinguishably, for an invalid token, a revoked link, and a
 *     draft/void invoice;
 *   - the shape check runs first, so a non-UUID never reaches Postgres;
 *   - the RPC payload carries display fields only (no ids), so this route
 *     cannot leak more than the page already shows;
 *   - the path prefix is in RATE_LIMITED_PREFIXES (lib/rate-limit.ts), so
 *     the proxy caps it per IP like every other public token surface.
 *
 * HOW TO TEST (locally, seed applied, INCOGNITO window):
 *   1. /invoice/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000070 → "Download PDF"
 *      saves the invoice; its totals match the page exactly.
 *   2. Revoke the link in the app → the same URL now answers 404.
 *   3. The draft invoice's seeded link (…0069) answers 404 too — drafts are
 *      never shared, and the visitor can't tell the two cases apart.
