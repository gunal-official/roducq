/**
 * /time — the hours log (Step 18, "timer + hours log" half two). Entries
 * are grouped by worked_on — the day the work happened, backdateable —
 * never by created_at. Today / this-month totals are computed in TS from
 * the fetched rows (nothing is stored that can drift).
 *
 * The floating timer pill (TimeTimer, mounted in the (app) layout) is the
 * other entry point; both write through app/(app)/time/actions.ts.
 *
 * HOW TO TEST (locally — ⚠ apply the time_entries migration + seed first):
 *   1. Open /time: four seeded entries in day groups (Today first):
 *      "Concept exploration — first visual directions" (3h 40m, today,
 *      Brightloop brief chip), "Kickoff — discovery call…" (2h 15m),
 *      "Portfolio refresh + client outreach" (1h, NO brief chip),
 *      "Phase-two proposal polish" (1h 30m). Header shows the today
 *      total + month total.
 *   2. "Log time" → description, minutes, date (defaults to today —
 *      backdating works), optional brief → Save lands it in the right
 *      day group and moves both totals.
 *   3. The floating pill (bottom-right on every app page): start it on
 *      /invoices, navigate — it keeps running; refresh mid-run — it
 *      survives (localStorage). Stop → the stop form opens with the
 *      elapsed minutes prefilled; Cancel returns to running, Save logs
 *      the entry.
 *   4. Edit (all fields) and delete (two-step confirm) each row.
 *   5. The brief filter shows one brief's entries; general entries only
 *      appear under "All time".
