/**
 * /reports — the platform rollup (Step 20, last platform-phase feature).
 * One server page: fetch invoices + time entries + contracts + briefs
 * for the ACTIVE workspace, compute everything in lib/reports.ts (pure
 * TS — nothing stored that can drift), render. No client island: fixed
 * windows, no picker, zero interactivity.
 *
 * HOW TO TEST (locally — requires the Step 17–19 seeds):
 *   1. Open /reports. MONEY: Collected $0.00 (0 paid), Outstanding
 *      $3,150.00 (1 sent — INV-0002 with its 5% tax), Draft $1,950.00
 *      (1 draft — INV-0001).
 *   2. TIME: Today 3h 40m (the seeded entry dated today), This month
 *      8h 25m, All time 8h 25m (all four seeded days — re-seeding near a
 *      month boundary can split "this month"/"all time"). By brief:
 *      "Brightloop Co. — Brand Identity Refresh" 7h 25m, "General —
 *      no brief" 1h.
 *   3. CONTRACTS: Signed 1, Sent 0, Draft 1; Expiring within 30 days
 *      0, Expired 0 (the seeds carry no expiry — set one on a draft to
 *      watch the counters move).
 *   4. Mutate anything (pay an invoice, log time, send a contract) →
 *      navigate back and the numbers follow — no cache, all computed.
