        roducq is a <strong className="font-medium text-text">client-work writing studio</strong>{": "}
        a single workspace for the writing trail that runs through every
        freelance or studio engagement — intake, briefs, proposals, plans,
        and client updates.

        Client work starts as scattered communication: an email here, a call
        note there, a &ldquo;quick question&rdquo; in chat. roducq takes
        that raw material as-is and structures it — flagging gaps early,
        keeping every source attached, and carrying the result forward stage
        by stage instead of asking you to re-type it into five different
        documents.
