/**
 * Service-role Supabase client — BYPASSES RLS. Server-side only; every
 * caller has its own trust boundary:
 *   1. the Stripe webhook route (app/api/stripe/webhook) — gated by the
 *      verified `Stripe-Signature` (test-mode keys only);
 *   2. the webhook retry sweep (app/api/cron/webhooks) — gated by
 *      `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`;
 *   3. the mailbox OAuth callback (app/api/email/callback) — gated by
 *      the signed state claim (lib/email/state);
 *   4. the mailbox server actions (app/(app)/settings/email-actions) —
 *      owner/editor-gated before the service write;
 *   5. the mailbox sync sweep (app/api/cron/email) — gated by
 *      `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`;
 *   6. Slack/Notion OAuth callbacks (app/api/{slack,notion}/callback) —
 *      gated by the signed state claim (lib/email/state);
 *   7. the integrations disconnect action
 *      (app/(app)/settings/integration-actions) — owner-gated before the
 *      service write.
 * Never import this from a page, component, or server action that runs
 * as a user without first passing its user-facing authorization checks —
 * plain user reads use lib/supabase/server.
